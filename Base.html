<p> <u>Ipsum: is simply dummy text</u> <br> of the printing and typesetting industry. 
    <h2>Lorem Ipsum</h2> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
     when an unknown <b>printer took a galley of type and scrambled</b> it to make a type specimen book. 
     It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
     remaining essentially unchanged.<abbr title="HyperText Markup language">HTML</abbr>   It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
     sheets  containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing 
     software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <a target="_blank" href="https://www.flipkart.com/">Lorem Ipsum.</a>
